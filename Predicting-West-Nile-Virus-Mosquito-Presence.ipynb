    "## Predicting West Nile Virus Presence in Mosquito Traps (Kaggle Competition)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following was a group project, completed with the help of two of my colleagues, to analyze and predict the presence of West Nile Virus (WNV) in mosquito traps in the Chicago, Illinois region. This project originated as a Kaggle competition, with teams being provided several data files from which to draw inferences and make predictions about the presence of WNV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two files (train and test) contained data on mosquito traps around the Chicago area. The train file comprised data from 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013 describing traps containing mosquitos, which included (among other variables) location of the trap, the species of mosquitos detected, the number of mosquitos counted, and whether WNV was detected within the mosquitos detected. The test file, by contrast, asked teams to predict the presence of WNV for the years 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014, given hypothetical information about each trap for specific observational days. That is, provided information about specific trap locations on specific days containing specific species of mosquitos, what is the probability that the trap contains WNV?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another file provided weather data for the Chicago area from 2007 to 2014, as collected from two separate airport weather stations (O'Hare and Midway).\n",
    "\n",
    "A final file provided spray data describing times and locations of pesticide spraying in the Chicago area for the years 2011 and 2013.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset, along with a more thorough description, can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary and Analysis:\n",
    "Exploring the initial training data included examining relationships between \"primary\" traps and related \"satellite\" traps that were in close proximity. Initial EDA also examined the consistency of trap locations across all years of the data.  While there were a few discrepencies discovered (e.g., two traps had more than one set of latitude and longitude coordinates across all years), the number of observations affected by these discrepencies were quite few and far between. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the initial training data, if more than 50 mosquitos of a specific species were found in a given trap on a given day, new observations were generated for each set of 50 mosquitos trapped, with a final observation containing any remainder. In the process of examining the data, we collapsed all rows of specific species for each trap on each day to more properly reflect the number of mosquitos actually observed, and to more accurately reflect the true number of WNV detections in the training data.  That is, if more than 50 mosquitos were found in a trap with WNV, there could potentially be more than one observation of WNV detected, whereas counting all of the mosquitos together would only produce a single observation of WNV.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To predict WNV presence in the test set, we engineered several features in an attempt to capture probability of WNV given specifics on the traps and mosquito species being observed. These included the number of years in the train data for which each trap contained WNV at any point, the maximum number of times in a single train year each trap contained WNV, \tthe total number of times each trap contained WNV in the train data, the proportion of observations for each trap in which WNV was detected, the proportion of observations for each mosquito species in which WNV was detected, and the proportion of observations for each species in each trap for which WNV was detected. These \"risk assessment\" variables were then applied to each trap and species where appropriate in the test data to approximate the relative likelihoods that any given observation might result in detection of WNV. Where specific traps existed in the test data that were not included in the train data, values were imputed based on the test traps' proximity to traps seen in the train set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also utilized several weather variables to predict the presence of WNV in the test data, including average temperature, total precipitation, air pressure, a 7-day rolling average of precipitation, and whether or not wind speed was 1 standard deviation above the mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "In developing our final model, we decided to more forward with a Bagged Gradient Boosting Classifier. \n",
    "The predicted accuracy of a bagged gradient boosting classifier was effectively the same as the standard \n",
    "GBC, and we felt as though the bagging process had the potential correct for some inherent error in the singular GBC\n",
    "by creating an ensemble model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submitting initial findings to Kaggle site resulted in a score of 0.66207 area under ROC curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvements to be considered for future work\n",
    "In terms of additional variables that could have assisted with our analyses, in retrospect, we should have more closely examined the most prominent months for WNV outbreaks. WNV outbreaks were most frequent in the month of August, and including a simply binary variables for \"Is_August\" might have provided more predictive power.  In addition, generating rolling average variables that take a wider assessment of heat and precipitation over the lifespan of a mosquito (e.g., several weeks rather than just a few days) might also have improved the general predictive power of our modeling.

    "# Every year from late-May to early-October, public health workers in Chicago setup mosquito traps scattered across \n",

    "# the presence of West Nile virus before the end of the week. The test results include the number of mosquitos, \n",
    "# the mosquitos species, and whether or not West Nile virus is present in the cohort. \n",
    "\n",
    "# These test results are organized in such a way that when the number of mosquitos exceed 50, they are split into \n",

    "# The location of the traps are described by the block number and street name. For your convenience, we have mapped \n",
    "# these attributes into Longitude and Latitude in the dataset. Please note that these are derived locations. \n",
